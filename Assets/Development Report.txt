Day 1: I wrote the necessary core managers for the game. I prepared scene transitions, basic scene components, and camera settings.
 Then, I wrote the grid classes that form the foundation of the game. I wrote the code for the grid cells, rows, and columns. 
 I completed the creation of the grid and the internal items in the game scene.

Day 2: I prepared the prefabs and classes for the blocks to be placed. I completed the mechanics for the blocks to be placed in the cells.
 I finished filling the cells according to the placed blocks. I also completed the interactions of the affected cells. Then I created the 
 score system for filling cells mechanic.
 
 Day 3: I completed the code for the scenarios that will occur when all the rows and columns are filled according to the cells filled on the grid. 
 I also added the score gaining and incrementing system. I also prepared game sfx system and added required sound effect files.
